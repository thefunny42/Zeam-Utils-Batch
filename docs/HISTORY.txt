1.2 (unreleased)
----------------

* ...

1.1 (2012-09-24)
----------------

* Add a new type of batch, AlphabeticalBatch, that like the DateBatch,
  and can be used to iterate through a fixed set of items like letters
  or digits.

* Fix a bug when the ``start`` value is higher than the number of
  element in the batch in the regular batch.

* Add two options ``min`` and ``max`` to the date batch in order to
  define possible limits for it.

1.0 (2011-11-07)
----------------

* Add a new batch component, ``DateBatch``, which is able to browser
  period of years or months.

* ``batch`` is renamed into ``Batch``. Methods have been renamed to
  follow pep8 recommandations (i.e. ``batchLen`` into ``batch_length``).

* Template have been reviewed: values are accessible via the template
  variable ``batch`` insted of directly. This fix an issue of
  compatiblity with Chameleon, where ``next`` could not be defined
  (that's a Python built-in).

0.7 (2010-10-05)
----------------

* Add a __len__ method do a batch object, which returns the number of
  objects viewable via this current batch. Like this, it can be used
  with tal:condition in templates.

* An option keep_form_data on the view prevent to include posted form
  data in generated links (sometime you want them, some other you
  don't).

----------------

* Generated batch links can include other parameters in the link. That
